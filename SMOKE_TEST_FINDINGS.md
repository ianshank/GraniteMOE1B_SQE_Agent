# Smoke Test Findings - Granite MOE Test Generator

## Test Summary

A smoke test was performed on the Granite MOE Test Generator to verify its basic functionality. The test was run on a new branch `feature/smoke-test-workflow`.

## Test Environment

- **OS**: macOS 24.5.0
- **Python**: 3.x
- **Branch**: feature/smoke-test-workflow
- **Date**: September 29, 2025

## Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Workflow Test**
   - Ran the main.py script without any configuration
   - Result: Completed successfully but generated 0 test cases

2. **Local-Only Mode Test**
   - Created a sample requirement file in data/requirements/sample/login_requirement.md
   - Ran with GRANITE_LOCAL_ONLY=true
   - Result: Completed successfully but generated 0 test cases

3. **Integration Configuration Test**
   - Used local_only_integration.yaml configuration
   - Created a sample user story in data/user_stories.json
   - Ran with INTEGRATION_CONFIG_PATH=local_only_integration.yaml
   - Result: Completed successfully but generated 0 test cases

## Issues Identified

1. **Path Resolution Issue**
   - The system is not correctly finding the sample requirement files
   - The log shows "Fetched 0 requirements from 0 files in data/requirements (skipped 0 files with errors)"
   - This suggests that either:
     - The path resolution is incorrect (looking in granite-test-generator/data/requirements instead of /data/requirements)
     - The file format is not recognized or is being filtered out

2. **User Stories Processing**
   - Despite creating a user_stories.json file, the system doesn't appear to be processing it
   - No logs indicate that user stories were processed or indexed

3. **Team Configuration**
   - Despite specifying teams in local_only_integration.yaml, the system falls back to the default team
   - Log shows "No teams configured. Using default local team."

## Recommendations

1. **Path Resolution Fix**
   - Verify the correct path resolution for requirements and user stories
   - Update the code to correctly resolve paths relative to the project root

2. **Debug Logging**
   - Add more detailed debug logging to trace the file discovery process
   - Log the absolute paths being searched to identify path resolution issues

3. **Team Configuration**
   - Verify the integration configuration loading logic
   - Ensure the INTEGRATION_CONFIG_PATH environment variable is being correctly processed

4. **Sample Data**
   - Create a more comprehensive set of sample data that follows the expected format
   - Document the required format for requirements and user stories

## Next Steps

1. Fix the path resolution issue to ensure requirements and user stories are correctly found
2. Enhance logging to provide more visibility into the workflow process
3. Update the documentation to clarify the expected data formats and directory structure
4. Create a more comprehensive smoke test script that verifies all components of the system

## Conclusion

The smoke test revealed that while the system runs without errors, it is not correctly processing the input data. This appears to be primarily due to path resolution issues rather than functional problems with the core logic. Once the path resolution is fixed, the system should be able to generate test cases as expected.
