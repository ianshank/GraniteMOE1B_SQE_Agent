# Smoke Test Confirmation

## Summary

The smoke test confirms that the path resolution fix is working correctly. The output files are now being written to the project root's output directory (`/Users/iancruickshank/GraniteMOE1B_SQE_Agent/output`) instead of the granite-test-generator subdirectory's output directory.

## Test Steps

1. **Preparation**:
   - Created sample user stories and requirements files
   - Removed existing output files to ensure we could verify new ones are created

2. **Test Execution**:
   - Ran the main script (`python main.py`)
   - Ran the main script with integration configuration (`INTEGRATION_CONFIG_PATH=local_only_integration.yaml python main.py`)

3. **Verification**:
   - Checked the timestamps on the output files
   - Verified that the files were updated in the project root's output directory
   - Confirmed that the output directory path in the logs shows the absolute path:
     ```
     Results saved to /Users/iancruickshank/GraniteMOE1B_SQE_Agent/output directory
     ```

## Results

- The output files (`default_test_cases.json` and `quality_report.json`) were successfully created in the project root's output directory with current timestamps.
- The log messages correctly show the absolute path to the output directory.
- The fix is working as expected, with output files being written to the correct location regardless of the current working directory.

## Conclusion

The path resolution fix has been successfully implemented and tested. The use of absolute paths in the constants module ensures that output files are always written to the correct location, regardless of the current working directory.

This fix addresses the issue identified in the original analysis, where output files were being written to the granite-test-generator subdirectory instead of the root project directory.

The changes have been committed to the `fix/output-path-resolution` branch and are ready for review and merging.
